### Goals

- Sub‑1s First Contentful Paint (mobile)
- Smooth interactions under poor networks
- Minimal CPU/memory overhead on host pages

### Techniques

- CDN delivery and long‑term caching for the loader
- Lazy/async iframe creation; defer heavy work to the portal
- PostMessage batching for fewer layout thrashes
- Automatic height updates to avoid jank
- Minimal bundle surface for the loader; most UI ships in the iframe

### Measuring

- RUM hooks in the portal (TTFB, FCP, CLS)
- Synthetic checks on critical flows
- Budget checks in CI for loader size
