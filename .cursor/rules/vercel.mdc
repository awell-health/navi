## When analyzing logs

First, call vercel's `list_deployments` function using params:

```
{
  "projectId": "prj_uC6CDdSGX0vB8XObUJWTiktx7g7f",
  "teamId": "team_zmInQ2q5T149EOKGuA1jQZQ5"
}
```

Once you've found the correct deployment (likely the first one, unless i give you a deployment ID), use the deployment id (not url) and get the deployment. from there, you should have the ability to fetch build logs if there is a problem with the build.
