# Cursor Rules Migration Summary

## 📁 Migration Overview

Successfully migrated from legacy `.cursorrules` to new `.cursor/rules/*.mdc` format.

## 🔄 What Changed

### **Before (Legacy)**

- Single `.cursorrules` file (283 lines)
- All rules combined in one document
- No automatic file attachment
- No rule type specificity

### **After (New Structure)**

```
.cursor/
├── rules/
│   ├── events-and-messaging.mdc      # Auto-attached to event-related files
│   └── authentication-and-security.mdc  # Always applied (critical security)
└── migration-summary.md              # This document
```

## 🎯 Rule Breakdown

### **events-and-messaging.mdc**

- **Type**: `auto_attached`
- **Scope**: Event-related files (`**/*activity*`, `**/*event*`, etc.)
- **Focus**:
  - Real-time activity streaming (SSE)
  - Cross-origin messaging patterns
  - GraphQL subscription architecture
  - Event performance requirements

### **authentication-and-security.mdc**

- **Type**: `always` (critical security rules)
- **Scope**: Auth-related files (`**/*auth*`, `**/*jwt*`, etc.)
- **Focus**:
  - Environment file protection (absolute rule)
  - HIPAA compliance requirements
  - JWT patterns and validation
  - Healthcare security standards

## 🔍 Key Improvements

1. **Focused Rules**: Each rule is domain-specific and under 500 lines
2. **Smart Attachment**: Rules auto-apply to relevant file patterns
3. **Priority System**: Critical security rules always apply
4. **Actionable Content**: More code examples and specific patterns
5. **Healthcare Context**: Specialized HIPAA and healthcare security focus

## 📚 Documentation Integration

The new rules extract and focus the most critical patterns from:

- `CLAUDE.md` (root) - Monorepo architecture
- `docs/CLAUDE.md` - Portal development patterns
- `awell-backend-module-navi/AGENTRULES.md` - Backend module specifics

## 🚨 Critical Rules Preserved

### **Environment Protection**

- Absolute rule about `.env` file modification
- Memory IDs preserved (2526200, 2526076)
- No bypass mechanisms allowed

### **v0.x.x Coordination**

- Breaking changes require asking first
- Cross-package testing mandatory
- API contract updates required

### **Healthcare Compliance**

- HIPAA logging patterns
- PHI protection standards
- Audit trail requirements

## ✅ Next Steps

1. **Test the new rules** with various file types
2. **Monitor rule effectiveness** in daily development
3. **Iterate based on usage** patterns
4. **Consider additional focused rules** as needed (e.g., performance, testing)

## 🔗 Legacy Reference

The original `.cursorrules` file remains available for reference but is no longer active. All critical rules have been migrated and enhanced in the new structure.
