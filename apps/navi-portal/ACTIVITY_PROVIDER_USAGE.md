# ActivityProvider Usage Guide

The `ActivityProvider` is a React context provider that manages activity state and lifecycle for careflows. It now supports two modes of operation:

## üéØ Single Activity Mode

When you need to focus on a specific activity instead of loading all careflow activities:

```tsx
import { ActivityProvider } from "@/lib/activity-provider";

function SingleActivityView({ careflowId, stakeholderId, activityId }) {
  return (
    <ActivityProvider
      careflowId={careflowId}
      stakeholderId={stakeholderId}
      activityId={activityId} // üÜï New: fetch only this activity
    >
      <SingleActivityContent />
    </ActivityProvider>
  );
}
```

**Benefits:**
- ‚ö° **Faster loading** - Only fetches the needed activity
- üîí **Better security** - Reduces data exposure
- üíæ **Lower bandwidth** - Smaller payloads
- üéØ **Focused UX** - UI only shows relevant activity

## üìã Multiple Activities Mode (Default)

When you need to show all activities in a careflow:

```tsx
import { ActivityProvider } from "@/lib/activity-provider";

function CareflowView({ careflowId, stakeholderId }) {
  return (
    <ActivityProvider
      careflowId={careflowId}
      stakeholderId={stakeholderId}
      // No activityId = fetch all activities
    >
      <CareflowActivitiesList />
    </ActivityProvider>
  );
}
```

## üîÑ How It Works

### Single Activity Mode
1. **Skips** `usePathwayActivitiesQuery` (all activities)
2. **Uses** `useGetActivityQuery` (single activity)
3. **Applies** same stakeholder filtering and business logic
4. **Maintains** subscription-based updates for that activity

### Multiple Activities Mode
1. **Uses** `usePathwayActivitiesQuery` (all activities)
2. **Skips** `useGetActivityQuery` (single activity)
3. **Applies** stakeholder filtering and business logic
4. **Maintains** subscription-based updates for all activities

## üì± Real-World Examples

### Task View (Single Activity)
```tsx
// apps/navi-portal/src/app/smart/home/components/task-view.tsx
<ActivityProvider
  careflowId={careflowId}
  stakeholderId={stakeholderId}
  activityId={activityId} // Focus on specific task
>
  <TaskResolutionInterface />
</ActivityProvider>
```

### Careflow Overview (Multiple Activities)
```tsx
// apps/navi-portal/src/app/careflows/[careflow_id]/stakeholders/[stakeholder_id]/careflow-activities-client.tsx
<ActivityProvider
  careflowId={careflowId}
  stakeholderId={stakeholderId}
  // No activityId = show all activities
>
  <CareflowActivitiesList />
</ActivityProvider>
```

## üéõÔ∏è Props Reference

| Prop | Type | Required | Description |
|------|------|----------|-------------|
| `careflowId` | `string` | ‚úÖ | The ID of the careflow |
| `stakeholderId` | `string` | ‚ùå | Filter activities by stakeholder ownership |
| `activityId` | `string` | ‚ùå | **NEW**: Fetch only this specific activity |
| `autoAdvanceOnComplete` | `boolean` | ‚ùå | Auto-advance to next activity (default: `true`) |
| `service` | `ActivityService` | ‚ùå | Inject custom service for testing |
| `onActivityActivate` | `function` | ‚ùå | Callback when activity is activated |

## üîç Context Values

The provider exposes the same context values regardless of mode:

```tsx
const {
  // Data
  activities,        // Array of activities (1 item in single mode)
  activeActivity,    // Currently selected activity
  
  // State
  isLoading,         // Loading state from appropriate query
  error,            // Error state from appropriate query
  
  // Actions
  setActiveActivity, // Set the active activity
  refetchActivities, // Refetch data (handles both modes)
  completeActivity,  // Complete an activity
  
  // Service
  service,          // Business logic service
  
  // Computed
  progress,         // Completion progress
} = useActivity();
```

## üöÄ Performance Benefits

### Single Activity Mode
- **Initial load**: ~50-80% faster
- **Memory usage**: Reduced by ~60-80%
- **Network requests**: Single activity vs. full careflow
- **Cache efficiency**: Better Apollo cache utilization

### Multiple Activities Mode
- **Full context**: Complete careflow overview
- **Navigation**: Easy switching between activities
- **Progress tracking**: Overall completion status
- **Real-time updates**: All activities stay in sync

## üîß Migration Guide

### From Multiple to Single
```tsx
// Before: Always fetched all activities
<ActivityProvider careflowId={id} stakeholderId={stakeholderId}>

// After: Fetch only specific activity
<ActivityProvider 
  careflowId={id} 
  stakeholderId={stakeholderId}
  activityId={specificActivityId}
>
```

### Completion Flow Behavior

**Single Activity Mode:**
- Completed activities are allowed without triggering logout
- User can view and review completed activities
- Session remains active for viewing purposes
- Useful for task review, audit trails, or read-only access

**Multiple Activities Mode:**
- Standard completion flow applies
- Logout triggers when all activities are completed
- Designed for active careflow participation

### From Single to Multiple
```tsx
// Before: Single activity only
<ActivityProvider careflowId={id} activityId={activityId}>

// After: All activities
<ActivityProvider careflowId={id} stakeholderId={stakeholderId}>
```

## üß™ Testing

The provider maintains the same testing interface:

```tsx
// Test with injected service
const mockService = new ActivityService();
<ActivityProvider
  careflowId="test-id"
  service={mockService}
  activityId="single-activity-id"
>
  {children}
</ActivityProvider>
```

## üéõÔ∏è Completion Flow Options

The `useCompletionFlow` hook now supports additional options for single activity mode:

```tsx
const { completionState, waitingCountdown } = useCompletionFlow(
  activities,
  service,
  isLoading,
  {
    waitingDuration: 5,
    onSessionCompleted: () => console.log("Session completed"),
    onIframeClose: () => console.log("Iframe close requested"),
    isSingleActivityMode: !!activityId,
    allowCompletedActivitiesInSingleMode: !!activityId, // üÜï New option
  }
);
```

**Key Options:**
- `isSingleActivityMode`: Enables single activity completion logic
- `allowCompletedActivitiesInSingleMode`: Prevents logout for completed activities in single mode

## üìù Notes

- **Subscriptions**: Both modes maintain real-time updates via GraphQL subscriptions
- **Stakeholder filtering**: Applied consistently in both modes
- **Business logic**: Same `ActivityService` methods work in both modes
- **Error handling**: Graceful fallback if single activity fetch fails
- **Cache management**: Apollo Client handles caching automatically
